\section{Interesting Quantum Programming Languages}
Qiskit, which is the most prominent and based around Python.
q1tsim, which is based on Rust and the docmentation is mostly in Rust
but apparently can be used in Python as well.
\section{Quantum Fourier Transform}
The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) transforms between two bases, the
computational (Z) basis, and the Fourier basis. It can be written as a
mapping
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:2}
  \ket{x} \mapsto \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum^{N-1}_{y=0}\omega^{xy}_{N}\ket{y}
\end{equation}
or as an unitary matrix
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:3}
  U_{\text{QFT}}= \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}\sum^{N-1}_{x=0}\sum^{N-1}_{y=0}\omega^{xy}_N\ket{y}\bra{x}.
\end{equation}
The H-gate is the
signle-qubit QFT, and it transfroms between the Z-basis states
$\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$ to the X-basis states $\ket{+}$ and
$\ket{-}$. In the same way, all multi-qubit states in the
computational basis have corresponding states in the Fourier
basis. The QFT is simply the function that transforms between these
bases.
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:1}
  \ket{\text{State in Computational Basis}}
  &\overset{QFT}{\longrightarrow} \ket{\text{State in Fourier
    Basis}}\\
  QFT\ket{x} &= \ket{\tilde{x}}.\\
\end{align}

In the computational basis, we store numbers in binary, just like a
Johnson Counter.
The first qubit has the highest frequency and changes every iteration,
while the last one has the lowest frequency.
In the Fourier basis, we store numbers using different rotations
around the Z-axis.
To encode the state $\ket{\tilde{5}}$ on 4 qubits, we rotate the
leftmost qubit by $\frac{5}{2^n} = \frac{5}{2^4} = \frac{5}{16}\times
2\pi \text{radians}$. For the next qubit the numerator is doubled,
thus $\frac{10}{16} \times 2\pi$.
This leads to the result, that now the first qubit has the lowest
frequency, while the fourth qubit has the quickest. Note that in the
Fourier basis, we are no longer counting binarily.
